## Basics

Metisa has two flows:
* [Tracking](#tracking)
* [Recommendation](#recommendaton)

##### Tracking

Metisa tracks your users' behaviour or purchases in order to come up with better personalised recommendations.

```html
<script>
  mt('p')
</script>
```

##### Recommendation

Once the tracking is set up, Metisa can now start feeding personalised recommendations for your users.
